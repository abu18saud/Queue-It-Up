# Queue-It-Up
Write a program that will take 3 numbers as input and store them in a defined queue.
Also, add code to output the sorted sequence of elements in the queue, separated by a space.


Sample Input
6
3
14

Sample Output
Queue: 6 3 14
Sorted: 3 6 14

To copy the queue into a new array, use the ToArray() method of the queue: int[] arr = queue.ToArray();.
Then, recall the Array.Sort() method.
